# concurrent_climate_extremes_in_east_africa
Here we analyse the influence of climate change on the frequency, spatial distribution and dependence of concurrent extreme events in East Africa. 

## Python Scripts
This repository includes two python scripts used in this anaylsis, namely:
### 1. [funcs.py](https://github.com/VUB-HYDR/concurrent_climate_extremes_in_east_africa/blob/8a322d247ee549efb340933b45f555c8d1ac0c5f/funcs.py)
This python script enntails all the functions used in this analysis. Users should first run this script, before running the main.py.

### 2. [main.py](https://github.com/VUB-HYDR/concurrent_climate_extremes_in_east_africa/blob/8a322d247ee549efb340933b45f555c8d1ac0c5f/main.py)
This python script entails all the methods used to analyse the dataset using the functions within funcs.py. Users shoud ensure that the main.py, funcs.py nad the dataset are all within the same directory before running this script.

## Python Environment
To ensure reproducibility of our analysis, the [env_concurrent_extremes_in_east_africa.yml](concurrent_climate_extremes_in_east_africa/env_concurrent_extremes_in_east_africa.yml) provides a clone of our python environment, with all of its packages and versions. Users should use their terminal or an Anaconda Prompt to create their environment using this env_concurrent_extremes_in_east_africa.yml.
